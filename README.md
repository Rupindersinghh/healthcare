Project Reflection

This project focused on applying Linear Regression to a healthcare dataset (500_Person_Gender_Height_Weight_Index.csv) to predict an individual's weight using their gender, height, and a body 'Index'. The goal was to build a straightforward predictive model that demonstrates how fundamental health metrics can contribute to understanding body composition. Initial data preparation involved mapping the categorical 'Gender' feature to numerical values (0 and 1) to suit the regression model. Linear Regression was chosen as the primary algorithm due to its inherent simplicity and interpretability, making it an ideal baseline to evaluate the direct relationships between the features and the target. Upon training and evaluation, the model yielded a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 266.64. This score, while indicating a reasonable initial fit, suggests that the model's predictions have an average squared deviation of this magnitude from the actual weights, highlighting room for error reduction. Moving forward, incorporating additional features such as age, activity level, or detailed dietary habits could significantly enhance prediction accuracy. Furthermore, exploring more advanced regression algorithms or ensemble methods would be valuable next steps to capture potentially non-linear relationships and improve overall model performance.
